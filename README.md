# Posture Extraction and Deduplication in Jathiswaram Dances via Similarity Filtering

This repository will contain the official implementation of the paper: _Posture Extraction and Deduplication in Jathiswaram Dances via Similarity Filtering_.

**Status**: Under Review in the _4th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Engineering (ICMLDE 2025), Elsevier_. [[Link]](https://www.icmlde.org/)

## Overview
Classical Indian dance forms like **Bharatanatyam** present rich, codified movement and expression vocabularies that are challenging to analyze computationally due to rhythmic complexity and semantic depth.

Moreover, the nuances hidden in each gesture/movement convey rich meanings to the audience based on context, movement combinations and countenance held while performing. This requires precision in motion segmentation, gesture decoding as well as generation, along with large datasets to ensure generalizability.
In this work, we propose the **first systematic framework** for posture-level extraction, deduplication and analysis in **Jathiswaram**, a core dance in a Bharatanatyam recital.

## Key Highlights
- **Annotated Dataset**: 400 manually annotated postures from five Jathiswaram performances across different Ragas.  
- **Novel Framework**: Lightweight, interpretable, and tailored for small datasets.  
- **Applications**: Choreographic analysis, expression analysis, cultural archiving, generative motion modeling.

## ‚è≥ Code Release
The source code, dataset preprocessing scripts, and evaluation pipeline will be released **after the review process is complete** and the decision of ICMLDE 2025 is announced.
